/**

 * It moves twice a second; everything else on [PlayerState] moves on a track
 * change. Carried in the same object, the two are one snapshot read — and
 * [rememberPlayerState] returns a value, which makes it non-restartable, which
 * pushes that read up into its *caller's* scope. In this app the caller is the
 * root of the whole UI, so a ticking playhead invalidated the entire tree twice
 * a second: every tab, both floating bars, and the three real-time blurs
 * underneath them, whether or not anything on screen showed a position.
 *
 * Split out and held behind a stable object, the tick is a read of this alone.
 * Whoever draws a scrubber reads it and recomposes; nobody else hears about it.
 * Take care to keep it that way — reading [positionMs] high in the tree and
 * passing the `Long` down puts the invalidation straight back where it was.

 * on a copy that is wrong. A source ranked above YouTube gets first refusal on
 * every track — see [SourceResolver.substituteForYouTube] — so a song can be
 * playing JioSaavn's or a module's idea of it from its very first second, with
 * nothing on screen having changed and nothing to undo. Those are precisely the
 * ones worth doubting: the match is made on title, artist and runtime, and a
 * live version, a remaster or a different mix agreeing on all three is a
 * catalogue's ordinary business. The listener is the only one who can hear that
 * it is the wrong recording, and until this was always available they had no
 * way to say so.
 *
 * The three exclusions are all "there is no such upload", not "reverting would
 * be unwise":
 *
 *  - a track queued from a module's own catalogue has no YouTube id at all,
 *    only a source-and-track key that would build a nonsense URI;
 *  - a file on the device is identified by its own `content://` or `file://`
 *    URI, for the same reason;
 *  - a music video *is* the YouTube upload, so there is nowhere for it to go.
 *    Its catalogue match is a separate control with its own way back — see
 *    `VideoAudioVersionButton`.
