/**
 * Decides whether one catalogue's track is the same recording as another's,
 * and what to ask that catalogue for in the first place.
 *
 * Split out of [SourceResolver] because it is the only part of the source
 * layer that is a judgement rather than plumbing, and because both of its
 * failure modes are silent:
 *
 *  - **Too loose** and the wrong recording plays under the right title — a
 *    cover, a remix, an hour-long loop — with nothing on screen to say so.
 *  - **Too strict** and the module the user configured is quietly never used,
 *    which is what "Paniyon Sa (From "Satyamev Jayate")" by Atif Aslam did
 *    against a catalogue holding the same audio as "Paniyon Sa" by
 *    Atif Aslam, Tulsi Kumar.
 *
 * The way out of both is to be explicit about *what part of a title carries
 * identity*. Services disagree constantly about the packaging — the film a
 * song is from, the "Official Audio" tag, which of the credited singers make
 * it into the title — and agree about the recording underneath. So the title
 * is taken apart into three pieces:
 *
 *  - [TitleParts.words], the title proper. Must agree exactly.
 *  - [TitleParts.versions], the words that mean *a different take* — remix,
 *    live, acoustic. Must agree exactly, in both directions: "Song (Live)"
 *    is not "Song", and neither is the other way round.
 *  - [TitleParts.context], everything else thrown away with the brackets.
 *    Never a veto, only a tie-break, because one service writing the film
 *    name in the title is not a disagreement about the audio.
 *
 * Artist and duration are then checked against that: a shared credit is
 * required when both sides name one, and a runtime far from the one asked for
 * rules a candidate out however well its title reads.

     * the correct answer to the question that was actually asked.

     * Each side of the pipe, though, is a well-formed `Artist - Title` on its

     * same place and for exactly the same reason — the channel is not the
     * artist — and searches for `the weeknd theweekndvevo`. A title with no
     * pipe is simply a single segment, and gets read the same way.
