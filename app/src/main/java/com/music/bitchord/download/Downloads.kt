 * to manage Downloads with a file manager, so an entry here can outlive the
 * file it names — which is why every read of it goes through [savedUri], and

     * one thing not written down anywhere.

     * arithmetic decide the outcome: [SourceResolver.forDownload] asks every
     * source with `waitForAll = true`, that flag buys each module the full 25s
     * patient window, and this timeout fired five seconds before the window it
     * was waiting on could even close. Every track whose modules were not
     * unusually quick came back null — not "no source has it", but "nobody was
     * asked for long enough" — and null here means YouTube. So a Lossless
     * setting reliably produced YouTube's AAC, and it looked like a bulk-only
     * fault because it *was* one: a single download runs with the engines to
     * itself and lands inside 20s, while four workers sharing three interpreter
     * engines per module (`QuickJsExecutor.ENGINES_PER_MODULE`) do not.
     *
     * Sized off what it actually bounds, therefore, rather than off the playback
     * timeout it used to be matched to. One patient search is 25s, the matcher
     * offers up to two queries (`TrackMatcher.queries`), and [streamBest] may
     * then open up to `STREAM_ATTEMPTS` stream endpoints on the winner. Sixty
     * seconds covers a slow-but-working index; it is still finite, because the
     * alternative is the queue stalled per track on modules that simply do not
     * have the recording.
     *
     * The comparison with playback is no longer the right one and is worth
     * stating plainly: `PlaybackService.SUBSTITUTE_TIMEOUT_MS` is short because
     * a listener is staring at a paused player. Nothing is waiting here, the
     * answer becomes a permanent file, and re-fetching it later costs the whole
     * download again.
     *
     * It bounds the lossy half of that lookup too, which is why
     * [SourceResolver.forDownload] runs both halves at once rather than in
