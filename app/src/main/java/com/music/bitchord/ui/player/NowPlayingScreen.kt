/**
 * The upward half of the sleeve's vertical gesture: dragged up, the artwork
 * block pulls the queue in behind it, following the finger the whole way and
 * settling to whichever end it was nearer on release.
 *
 * Downward is deliberately not ours. The sheet the player sits in is what closes
 * when the sleeve is dragged that way, and it can only read a drag it was
 * allowed to see — so a downward crossing of the touch slop is left entirely
 * alone and this returns having consumed nothing at all.
 *
 * Which of the two it is can only be known at the crossing, which is why the
 * decision is made there rather than at the press. A pointer event reaches a
 * child before its parent, so consuming the very event that crossed the slop is
 * enough to keep the sheet out of an upward drag, and letting that one event
 * through is enough to hand it a downward one — the sheet's own slop detector
 * gives up the moment it sees a change already spoken for.
 *
 * @param travel how far the sleeve has to be dragged for the queue to arrive.
 * @param slide the 0..1 the player's whole layout reads off.
 * @param onHold true while the finger owns [slide] and false when it hands it
 *   back; the settling animation is parked in between so the two never write the
 *   same value on alternate frames.
 * @param onSettle the state the release decided on, which that animation then
 *   finishes reaching from wherever the finger left off.

 * Where a held row is being held, what it may do from there, and the moves it

 *

 * being held, in the LazyColumn's own viewport pixels. The finger moves it and
 * nothing else does — not a scroll, not a swap, not a relayout. Everything
 * drawn or decided is then read back off the live layout against it: the row
 * is drawn at whatever its slot currently is plus the distance to
 * [heldCenter], and it trades places with whichever neighbour's slot
 * [heldCenter] has reached into.
 *
 * Tracking where the row is rather than how far it has come is what lets the
 * drag survive the list moving underneath it. The offset this replaces was
 * kept by hand — corrected on every scrolled pixel and again on every swap —
 * and held together only for as long as it was told about every last thing
 * that moved the list. It wasn't: LazyColumn re-anchors its own scroll
 * position when the row it measures from is reordered elsewhere (see
 * [swapTarget]), and one such jump left the offset a full row wrong, the row
 * drawn a row off the finger and its slot pushed clean out of the viewport.
 * Read fresh off the layout there is nothing left to be wrong — wherever the
 * list has ended up, the row is still under the finger.
