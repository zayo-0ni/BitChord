/**
 * The decisions a download makes before a byte is fetched: what the file is
 * called, whether Android will keep one of it at all, what quality goes into it,
 * and whether the connection in hand is allowed to fetch it.
 *
 * The first two are worth pinning because both fail late and badly. A wrong
 * extension or MIME type is not a compile error and not a bad-sounding download
 * — it is `IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported MIME type` from inside a
 * `ContentResolver.insert`, several frames from anything naming the track, which
 * is precisely how every download in a build once failed while reporting itself
 * as a connection problem.
 *
 * The last two are worth pinning because they fail silently instead. A download
 * capped by the wrong setting is a file that plays perfectly and is not what was
 * asked for, and nothing about it looks wrong from outside.
